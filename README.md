### Overview

This project involve the use of two dataset to gain insights into historical trends, regional variations, and factors influencing food prices in Nigeria. The project stores and manages two primary datasets: food prices in Nigeria (wfp_food_prices_nga) and economic indicators (Economic_indicators), facilitating easy access and manipulation of relevant information. The project will focus on using SQL queries to extract meaningful information and present it descriptively and where appropriate visually for stakeholders.

                                                        5. Execute SQL Queries with MySQL Workbench: Open MySQL Workbench and connect to your MySQL database. Then, execute the SQL queries provided in your SQL query file.
                                                        
### EDA

The project enables users to perform exploratory data analysis, allowing them to understand the distribution and characteristics of the data.
Users can explore temporal trends, regional variations, inflation impact, seasonal patterns, price volatility, and market-specific insights within the dataset.

### Findings

Based on the queries and interpretations provided regarding regional, temporal, seasonal trends, market-specific insights and inflation impact on food prices in Nigeria, the overall findings can be summarized as follows:

#### Regional Disparities
There are significant variations in food prices across different regions of Nigeria. Factors such as market dynamics, infrastructure, local production capacity, and economic conditions contribute to these disparities.

#### Temporal Trends
Food prices in Nigeria exhibit both short-term fluctuations and long-term trends. Variations in inflation rates, changes in market demand, policy interventions, and external economic factors influence the trajectory of food prices over time.

#### Seasonal Patterns
Seasonal fluctuations play a crucial role in shaping food prices, particularly in agricultural economies like Nigeria. Dry and rainy seasons impact agricultural productivity, supply chains, and consumer demand, leading to seasonal price variations in food items.

#### Inflation Impact
Inflation rates have a significant impact on food prices, affecting consumer purchasing power and the overall cost of living. High inflation rates generally lead to increased food prices, while low inflation rates may contribute to price stability, influencing consumption patterns and market dynamics.

#### Market-Specific Insights
Analysis at the market level provides insights into localized pricing dynamics, demand-supply imbalances, and consumer behavior. Understanding market-specific factors such as transportation costs, regional preferences, and market integration is essential for effective pricing strategies and supply chain management.

#### Price Volatility
Price volatility varies across commodities, regions, and time periods. Certain commodities exhibit high volatility due to factors such as seasonality, market speculation, supply chain disruptions, and external shocks. Managing price volatility is crucial for ensuring food security, market stability, and sustainable economic development.

### Methods
This project employs a combination of statistical methods, visualization techniques, and exploratory tools to gain insights, identify patterns, and uncover relationships within the dataset, laying the groundwork for further analysis and interpretation. The goal is to gain insights into the data and identify patterns or trends. The dataset used in this project was obtained from World Food Programme and from the World Bank data. Details regarding data collection can be found in [https://data.humdata.org/dataset/wfp-food-prices-for-nigeria?#] and [https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/FP.CPI.TOTL.ZG?locations=NG] respectively. Prior to analysis, the data underwent extensive preprocessing steps, including data cleaning, missing value imputation, and feature scaling. The EDA process involved descriptive statistics, data visualization using python Matplotlib, correlation analysis, and distribution analysis.

### Limitations

The analysis is subject to various limitations, including data quality issues, limited scope, and the complexity of factors influencing food prices. Firstly, the quality and availability of data from the wfp_food_prices_nga and nga_inflation_data tables heavily influence the analysis. Incomplete, inaccurate, or outdated data may skew the results and compromise the reliability of insights derived. Additionally, the analysis primarily focuses on historical trends and correlations between food prices, seasons, regions, and inflation rates. While valuable, this approach may overlook real-time market dynamics, emerging trends, or short-term fluctuations that could significantly impact food prices. Furthermore, generalizing insights from aggregated data across different regions and markets in Nigeria may oversimplify complex market dynamics and fail to account for regional variations, cultural differences, and socioeconomic factors influencing food prices. Moreover, the analysis does not fully consider external factors beyond inflation rates that can influence food prices, such as weather patterns, geopolitical events, trade policies, market speculation, and global economic trends. Lastly, while correlations between variables like food prices and inflation rates are identified, establishing causal relationships requires more rigorous statistical analysis and consideration of confounding variables. Correlation does not imply causation, and other unobserved factors may contribute to observed trends. These limitations underscore the need for cautious interpretation of the analysis results and highlight areas for further research and refinement of methodologies.

### Recomendations

To address the limitations mentioned above, several key recommendations are proposed. Firstly, enhancing data collection methods, data quality assurance processes, and data integration techniques is essential to ensure the accuracy, completeness, and reliability of food price and inflation data. Leveraging alternative data sources and advanced analytics tools can provide more comprehensive insights into market dynamics.

Furthermore, conducting granular analysis at the regional, market-specific, and commodity levels can capture localized trends, market dynamics, and consumer preferences more effectively. Utilizing spatial analysis techniques, market surveys, and qualitative research methods alongside quantitative analysis can provide richer insights and a deeper understanding of the underlying factors driving food prices.

Developing dynamic econometric models and predictive analytics frameworks is crucial for forecasting future food price trends, inflation rates, and market conditions. Integration of machine learning algorithms, time series analysis, and scenario planning techniques can help anticipate market disruptions and inform proactive decision-making strategies.

Additionally, performing multivariate analysis to explore the interplay between food prices, inflation rates, and various socioeconomic, environmental, and policy variables is essential. Adopting causal inference methods, propensity score matching, and instrumental variable analysis can aid in identifying causal relationships and mitigating biases in the analysis.

Fostering collaboration and knowledge-sharing among diverse stakeholders, including government agencies, academic institutions, NGOs, private sector organizations, and community groups, is key to addressing complex food security challenges. Encouraging interdisciplinary research, participatory approaches, and stakeholder consultations can facilitate the co-creation of solutions and enhance the effectiveness of interventions.

Implementing evidence-based policy evaluation frameworks and adaptive management practices is essential for assessing the effectiveness of interventions, monitoring implementation progress, and iterating on policy designs iteratively. Embracing feedback loops, performance metrics, and impact evaluations can enhance policy learning and institutional capacity-building efforts.

Moreover, promoting transparency, accountability, and open data initiatives is crucial to empowering citizens, civil society organizations, and the media to access, analyze, and interpret food price and inflation data. Fostering a culture of data-driven decision-making, knowledge sharing, and public engagement can promote greater social inclusion and democratic governance.
