## SEASONAL PATTERNS
###  A seasonal analysis to identify patterns in food prices that may be influenced by agricultural cycles or external factors.
  
#### Seasonal trends in prices considering dry and rainy seasons, ordered by year, month, and day
```sql
            SELECT
                YEAR(date) AS year,
                MONTH(date) AS month,
                DAY(date) AS day,
                CASE
                    WHEN MONTH(date) IN (11, 12, 1, 2, 3) THEN 'Dry Season'  -- November to March
                    WHEN MONTH(date) BETWEEN 4 AND 10 THEN 'Rainy Season' -- April to October
                    ELSE 'Unknown'
                END AS season,
                AVG(price) AS average_price
            FROM wfp_food_prices_nga
            GROUP BY year, month, day, season
            ORDER BY year, month, day, season;
```
The SQL query you provided retrieves data from a table named wfp_food_prices_nga, presenting information about
the average price of food items over different years, months, and days, categorized by the dry and rainy seasons. 
Below is a descriptive insight and interpretation of the data:

Seasonal Variation: The data is organized based on the seasonal variation in Nigeria, specifically into 
"Dry Season" and "Rainy Season". This categorization allows for an analysis of how food prices fluctuate between 
these two predominant seasons.

Price Trends: The average price of food items varies significantly across different seasons and years. For instance, 
during the dry season, prices tend to be relatively lower compared to the rainy season in certain years. However, 
there are notable exceptions where prices spike during the dry season, especially in recent years like 2022 and 2023.

Yearly Fluctuations: There is a visible trend of fluctuation in food prices from year to year. Certain years witness 
substantial increases in food prices, while others show relatively stable or decreasing trends. For example, the data 
shows a sharp increase in food prices during the dry season of 2022 compared to previous years.

Outliers and Anomalies: There are instances where certain months or years exhibit exceptionally high or low average 
prices, indicating potential outliers or anomalies in the data. These outliers could be attributed to various factors 
such as economic conditions, supply chain disruptions, or changes in consumer behavior.

Impact of External Factors: The fluctuations in food prices could be influenced by various external factors such as 
weather patterns, agricultural productivity, inflation rates, government policies, and global market trends. Analyzing 
these factors alongside the price data can provide valuable insights into the drivers behind food price dynamics in Nigeria.

Potential Insights: Further analysis of the data could involve identifying correlations between food prices and external 
variables, forecasting future price trends, assessing the impact of policy interventions on food affordability, and exploring 
regional variations in price dynamics across different parts of Nigeria.

Overall, the SQL query provides a structured framework for analyzing historical food price data and offers insights into the 
seasonal patterns, trends, and fluctuations in food prices in Nigeria. Further analysis and interpretation of the data can help 
policymakers, economists, and stakeholders make informed decisions regarding food security, economic development, and 
social welfare initiatives.

#### Analyze Seasonal Trends in Food Prices with Inflation:
```sql
        SELECT
            YEAR(wf.date),
            wf.admin1 AS region,
            wf.price,
            ni.InflationConsumerPrices,
            CASE
    
                WHEN MONTH(date) IN (11, 12, 1, 2, 3) THEN 'Dry Season'  -- November to March
                WHEN MONTH(wf.date) BETWEEN 4 AND 10 THEN 'Rainy Season' -- April to October
                ELSE 'Unknown'
            END AS season
        FROM
            wfp_food_prices_nga wf
        JOIN
            nga_inflation_data ni ON YEAR(wf.date) = ni.Year
        ORDER BY
            YEAR(wf.date), region;
```

The SQL query you provided retrieves data from two tables: wfp_food_prices_nga and nga_inflation_data, and it outputs a total 
of 56,544 rows. Here's an insight and interpretation of the query results:

Data Integration: The query integrates information from two datasets: food prices in Nigeria (wfp_food_prices_nga) 
and inflation data (nga_inflation_data). By joining these datasets on the basis of the year, it allows for a 
comprehensive analysis of food prices in the context of inflation rates.

Temporal and Regional Analysis: The query retrieves data by year and region. This allows for the examination of
temporal trends and regional variations in food prices and inflation rates across different parts of Nigeria.

Seasonal Categorization: The query categorizes the data into three seasons: "Dry Season", "Rainy Season", and 
"Unknown", based on the month of the year. This seasonal categorization helps in analyzing how food prices and 
inflation rates vary across different seasons, which could be influenced by factors such as agricultural production, 
weather patterns, and consumer demand.

Impact of Inflation: By including inflation data in the query, it enables the analysis of how changes in inflation 
rates correlate with fluctuations in food prices. High inflation rates can contribute to increased food prices, affecting 
the affordability of essential goods for consumers.

Insights into Economic Dynamics: The query results can provide insights into the broader economic dynamics of Nigeria, 
including the impact of inflation on consumer purchasing power, the effectiveness of monetary and fiscal policies in 
controlling inflation, and the resilience of the agricultural sector in responding to seasonal variations and economic shocks.

Policy Implications: The analysis of food prices and inflation trends can inform policymakers, government agencies, 
and international organizations in designing and implementing strategies to address food security challenges, mitigate 
the impact of inflation on vulnerable populations, and promote sustainable economic development.

Further Analysis Opportunities: The large dataset generated by the query offers opportunities for further analysis, 
including trend analysis, correlation studies between food prices and inflation, forecasting future price movements, 
and identifying socio-economic factors influencing regional disparities in food affordability and inflation rates.

In summary, the SQL query facilitates a comprehensive analysis of food prices and inflation dynamics in Nigeria, 
providing valuable insights into the economic conditions, challenges, and opportunities facing the country's food 
    security and macroeconomic stability.
